		<h3><span>What is Round 1?</span></h3>
		<p>
			We are the official competitive video games club
 for James Madison University. We have weekly RanBats and tournaments every
 month. From Smash to Tekken 7 to Duck Game to Mario Cart, if you can compete
 against someone, we play it! From beginner to advanced, all levels of play
 are welcome in Round 1. Our goal is to keep the competitive video game
 scene bumping here in Harrisonburg. We love teaching new players! If you're
 even a bit curious just come by one of our meetings or join our Facebook 
 group. <br> Weekly meetings are held Wednesday on campus in MU 404
 from 7-10PM!
